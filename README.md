# Specification for .Bh5 file format to store data from Brillouin microscopy
The aim of this repository is to define and discuss a standard file format for Brillouin microscopy.

## What is Brillouin microscopy?
Brillouin microscopy is essentially a hyperspectral imaging technique which extends Brillouin spectroscopy to microscopy.
In the recent years it has found increasing applications in biomedical imaging for its potential of assessing the mechanical
properties of various biological samples (for more information you can find many reviews about the topic,
e.g. [Kabakova et al 2024](https://doi.org/10.1038/s43586-023-00286-z) and [Prevedel et al. 2019](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-019-0543-3)).
Different approaches can be used to acquire the Brillouin signal (e.g. spontaneous, stimulated, time-domain) but ultimately
they all collect a spectrum for each voxel in the image. Typically, few parameters are extracted from each spectrum 
(e.g. Brillouin shift and width) and displayed as color maps.

## Motivation for a standard file format
As more and more data are been produced from different instruments and various labs and commercial Brillouin microscopes
are entering the market, we advocate for the establishment of a common file format to store the raw as well as processed
Brillouin spectral data, together with metadata that is important to understand the context of any given experiment.

This repository contains a proposal for a file format that contains all the necessary information to analyze/interpret 
Brillouin data in a standard way while being flexible to accommodate data from different approaches/setups.
We expect this standardization in file format to significantly facilitate collaborations, mutual comparisons of experimental results,
as well as promote more universal and collaborative development of software for data analysis and visualization.

## Why HDF5?
The [HDF5 file](https://www.hdfgroup.org/solutions/hdf5/) format can provide a versatile solution, as it allows to store
complex imagery as well as underlying raw data in a hierarchical and well-structured manner. It is already used in many
industries and scientific fields and also supported by many popular languages ([Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/hdf5-files.html),
[Python](https://docs.h5py.org/en/stable/), [R](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/rhdf5/inst/doc/rhdf5.html),
[LabVIEW](https://www.ni.com/de/support/downloads/tools-network/download.live-hdf5.html), [C/C++](https://docs.hdfgroup.org/archive/support/HDF5/doc1.8/cpplus_RM/index.html),
[Rust](https://docs.rs/hdf5/latest/hdf5/), just to name some), which will make software development (both to generate
the file and to access the data) easier. Furthermore there are plugins for [FIJI](https://fiji.sc/) and [Napari](https://napari.org/),
which can read the images contained in a HDF5 file.

There are also tools that can help you visualize the content of any HDF5 (e.g. the software [HDFView](https://www.hdfgroup.org/download-hdfview/)
or [this online tool](https://myhdf5.hdfgroup.org/)).

## Input from the community is encouraged!
People from the community are encouraged to provide suggestions on how to extend/modify the specifications to make the
.Bh5 format suitable for data generated by different setups and adapt it to their needs. Please keep in mind that
the content of the file should be as self-descriptive as possible to allow anyone to interpret the data without extra
information and also, importantly, have a well-defined and common structure so that software can extract as much
information as possible in an automated fashion.

To provide input or discuss specific issues you can create [GitHub
issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues).
